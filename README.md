# Recipe Manager API 🍕🍲🥧🍨

## Project Description
Recipe Manager is a backend project build with Django Framework. 
This project simply allows users to manage recipes, create their own recipes or view recipes from others, update them and delete them. 

✨This is one of my first backend projects. I created it to learn the working practices of backend systems and better understand CRUD operations. 
It was also part of the learning process of the BTU's project "Coding School for 15000 Women", where I created this project independently.
